All steps for the project code have been clearly marked using a markdown. Each step is self contained section for the notebook which can be expanded and collapsed.

Few steps would help to run the code and evaluate.

1. In Step 1: Add the API key for OpenAI
2. Run each cell in Step 3
3. No need to run the section "Test: Use a basic query and RAG approach to get LLM output for user query."
4. Add the user preference in Step 4 section by modifying the hardcoded answers.
5. Run each subsequent cell till the last and it will return a personalised summary.
